## Splash Shell Usage 

- Compile the smash.c file and run the executable
- You will then be "inside" the shell and see the prompt `splash> `, which means
  you are now able to run any command you like
  - **NOTE**: Aside from `pwd`, `cd`, `exit`, and `loop`, you will need to pass
    the command you want to run in its executable form (i.e. /bin/ls)
- As for the `loop` command, it allows you to run a specific command a specified
  `n` number of times (i.e. `loop 2 cd ../` will bring you back two directories)
